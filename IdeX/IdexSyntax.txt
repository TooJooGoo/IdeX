IdeX Request syntax	
-------------------
	An IdeX request is a string that contains a linefeed separated list of request lines. A request line can be of type "marker", "param" or "action".
	marker line
		A marker line marks a request as an IdeX request. The marker is used by the receiver to approve a request. The marker is an alphanumeric string. The default value is "IDEX". If present, a marker line must be the first line of a request.
	param line
		A param line contains a single parameter. Name and value are separated by an equal sign. The order of param lines is not important. Sample: ClientId = IdexClient
	action line
		An action line contains a single action. An action is parsed and executed by the IdeX server. The order of action lines is important. The actions are executed sequentially from top to bottom. An action line can be of type "get", "set" or "output".
		get action
			A get action instructs the server to get data. A get action starts with "g ".
			Sample: g ActiveDocument.Selection.Text
		set action
			A set action instructs the server to set data. A set action starts with "s ".
			Sample: s ServerId = NewServerId
		output action
			An output action writes a string to the response. The string is written "as is". There are no escape chars. The output action helps to format the response string. An output action starts with "o ".

	Listing: The following request has four request lines. The first line is the marker line. It contains the string "IDEX". The second and third lines are param lines. The param "ServerId" is set to value "IdexServer" and the param "ClientId" is set to "IdexClient". The last line is a "get" action line which instructs the server to get the selected text from the active document.
	
	IDEX
	ServerId = IdexServer
	ClientId = IdexClient
	g ActiveDocument.Selection.Text
	
IdeX Params	
-----------
	The IdeX syntax allows the following params:
	
	ServerId
		The ServerId stores the IdeX server identification. The client logic uses this parameter to locate the server process.
	
	ClientId
		The ClientId stores the IdeX client identification. The server logic uses this parameter to locate the client process.
